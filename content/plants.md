## Categories
Note that plants are broken down into categories. This helps keep them organized. Each category will be on it's own layer. And the categories can be collapsed in the planting tool, allowing you to focus on inserting a few types of plants as your design progresses.

## Inserting plants into your drawing
Plants can be inserted either by selecting a plant or simply clicking on the plant symbol. Plants will be placed in the drawing where you click. You can also copy plants using the *copy* command.

## Labeling Plants
The *Label Plants* button will allow you to label selected plants with an MLeader. Style of the leader can be edited via the AID_PlantLabel Multileader style.  If the extension line on the labels is distracting freeze the *prefix-LabelExtension* layer.

## Plant Quantities.
The plant quantities button can be used to export a quantity table for the selected plants to either Excel or text files. 

## Plant Schedule
The plant schedule button will prompt for a group of plants, and place a table or legend into the drawing for the selected plants.

## Swap
This button will swap plants selected in the drawing with the selected plant on the tool palette.
